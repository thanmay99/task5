            <p>3D food printing is the process of manufacturing food products using a variety of additive manufacturing
                techniques.</p>
            <P>The most advanced 3D food printers have pre loaded recipes on board and allows the user to remotely
                design
                their food on their computers , phones , or some IOT devices.</P>
            <p>The food can be customized in shape , color , texture , flavor , or nutrition. </p>

            <p>
                Year : 2006
                Cornell university
                Fab@Home a project led by a group of students, was the first multi material 3D printer to print food
                materials such as chocolate , cookie dough and cheese.

                Personal nutrition:
                3D printed food can provide the control necessary to put a custom amount of protein, sugar, vitamins,
                and minerals into the food we consume.
                Space exploration:
                As humans begin venturing into space for a longer time, the nutritional requirements for maintaining
                crew health is critical.
                Meat bioprinting:
                We can print a plant based meat and mimic the texture and appearance of real meat.
                By this we can avoid live stock farming.
                Cultured meat can also be produced by extracting stem cells from animals.
                Creative food design:
                Food presentation and food appearance customization for individuals is a big trend in the food
                industries.
                Chefs can now turn visual inspirations into signature creations.
                Another benefit is to print nutritious meals in shapes that appeal to children.
                Reduce food waste:
                Worldwide, one third of the total food produced for consumption , around 1.6 billion tons per year, goes
                to waste.
                Food waste happens during processing, distribution and consumption.
                3D food printing is a very promising way of reducing food waste.
                Chefs are also creating different dishes from leftover food using 3D food printing.

                Structure:
                Unlike traditionally prepared food, the variety of food that can be manufactured using 3D printing is
                limited by the physical characteristics of the materials. Food materials are generally much softer than
                the weakest plastic used in 3D printing, making the printed structures very fragile.
                Multi-material printing:
                The color, flavor and texture of food are of crucial importance when fabricating an edible product, thus
                in most cases it is required that a food printer supports multi-material printing. The current available
                3D food printers are limited to using a few different materials due to the challenge of developing
                multiple extruder capabilities.
                Copyright:
                Existing food products in the market such as chocolates in various shapes could easily be scanned and
                the obtained 3D models could be used to replicate those products. These 3D models could then be
                disseminated via Internet leading to copyright infringement. There are laws regulating copyright issues
                but it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to cover all aspects of a field like 3D food
                printing.
